## 1. Euler's Polyhedral Formula - Simplicial
> Induction

If a *Euler characteristic* suites for a simplicial disk with **F** faces, then it must suites for disk with **F-1** faces which reduced from the last one, since it's not a *global* change. Eventually, it must suites for disk just have one triangle, which have **3** vertices, **3** edges, and **1** faces, then:
$$
V-E+F=3-3+1=1.
$$
A sphere is equivalent to a **tetrahedron** which have **4** vertices, **6** edges, and **4** faces, then:
$$
V-E+F=4-6+4=2.
